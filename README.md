# Compare Sin Functions

This project was developed to demonstrate how using RNN could learn how to distinguish between two temporal signals.

For temporal singals, I use different sin wave functions.

There are two seperate programs. One uses `tensorflow.keras.layers.SimpleRNN` and the other uses `tensorflow.keras.layers.LSTM`.
